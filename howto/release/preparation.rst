Release Preparation
===================

As release date approaches and development slows visit the `jira versions dashboard <https://jira.opencord.org/projects/VOL?selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin%3Arelease-page&status=unreleased>`.
- Create a new dashboard for the future release candidate.
- Visit the current release candidate and move all unresolved tickets into the future desktop.
- On release day click the [Release] button to close out the desktop.
